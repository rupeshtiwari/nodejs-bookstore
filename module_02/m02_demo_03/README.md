## Benefits of Using Value Objects
- Encapsulation and Consistency: Value objects encapsulate the validation logic for ISBN and price, ensuring consistent application across the system.
- Reduced Duplication: By centralizing logic within value objects, we eliminate the need for repeated validation code in every entity or service that deals with these concepts.
- Immutability: Operations on value objects, like applying a discount to a price, return new instances, preserving the immutability principle in DDD. This makes the system more predictable and easier to debug.
- Domain Modeling Clarity: Value objects allow for clearer domain modeling by explicitly representing domain concepts and their behaviors, improving the expressiveness and understanding of the domain model.
