## CQRS Example

**Top-Level Use Case:**
A customer places an order on the BookStoreHub platform. The Order Service within the Order Processing bounded context receives the command to place an order and validates it. Upon successful validation, it publishes an event that the Inventory Service subscribes to, triggering a reservation of stock. Once the order is completed, an event is published which the Reviews Service listens to, prompting the customer to leave a review. Simultaneously, the Recommendation Service updates its recommendations based on the customer's purchase history using state reconstruction from past events.

Here is a high-level modeling of the use case "Place an Order" within the context of CQRS and the various components involved, including the libraries and cloud technologies that could be used:

1. **Order Processing Bounded Context:**
   - **Component: Order Service**
     - **Responsibility:**
       - Receives and validates new order commands.
       - Publishes order events.
     - **Library:**
       - Use `node-eventstore-client` for event handling.
     - **Concepts Demonstrated:**
       - Command (for placing an order).
       - Event handling (when an order is placed).
     - **Communicates with:**
       - Book Inventory Service to reserve books.
       - Payment Service for transaction processing (not mentioned but implied for a complete use case).

2. **Book Inventory Bounded Context:**
   - **Component: Inventory Service**
     - **Responsibility:**
       - Manages book stock levels.
       - Subscribes to order events to reserve stock.
     - **Library:**
       - Use `node-eventstore-client` for event subscriptions.
     - **Concepts Demonstrated:**
       - Query (to check stock levels).
       - Event handling (to reserve stock when an order is placed).
     - **Communicates with:**
       - Database to update stock levels (use `sequelize` for ORM).

3. **Customer Reviews Bounded Context:**
   - **Component: Reviews Service**
     - **Responsibility:**
       - Collects customer reviews for purchased books.
       - Subscribes to order completion events to request reviews.
     - **Library:**
       - Use `node-eventstore-client` for event subscriptions.
     - **Concepts Demonstrated:**
       - Event handling (to prompt for reviews post-purchase).
     - **Communicates with:**
       - Database to store reviews (could use `mongoose` for a MongoDB database).

4. **Recommendation System Bounded Context:**
   - **Component: Recommendation Service**
     - **Responsibility:**
       - Provides book recommendations.
       - Uses state reconstruction to personalize recommendations based on customer history.
     - **Library:**
       - Use `node-eventstore-client` for event sourcing and reconstructing state.
     - **Concepts Demonstrated:**
       - State reconstruction (to build user profiles for recommendations).
     - **Communicates with:**
       - Database to store user preferences and history.

5. **Event Logging:**
   - **Component: Event Store**
     - **Responsibility:**
       - Logs all events in the system for audit and replayability.
     - **Library:**
       - Use `node-eventstore-client` for event storage.
     - **Concepts Demonstrated:**
       - Event logs (to store and manage events).
     - **Cloud Technology:**
       - Could be hosted on AWS using Amazon DynamoDB for storage or Azure Event Hubs.

6. **State Reconstruction:**
   - **Component:**
     - State reconstruction could occur within the Recommendation Service as it needs to maintain the state of user preferences.
     - **Concepts Demonstrated:**
       - State reconstruction (to update recommendation systems).



The above architecture leverages Node.js and the `node-eventstore-client` library to demonstrate CQRS, event handling, state reconstruction, and event logging. For cloud technologies, AWS services like DynamoDB or Azure services like Event Hubs could be integrated to support the event storage and processing needs of the system.

## Directory Structure

Based on the information from the course document, let's outline the directory structure, filenames, test folders, and test files to implement the microservices architecture discussed.

The top-level directory will be divided into several subdirectories, each corresponding to a bounded context within the `BookStoreHub` microservices architecture. The directory structure will reflect Domain-Driven Design principles, separating concerns into distinct modules.

Here's a high-level directory structure:

```
BookStoreHub/
├── OrderProcessing/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── models/
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── unit/
│   │   └── integration/
│   └── index.js
├── BookInventory/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── models/
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── unit/
│   │   └── integration/
│   └── index.js
├── CustomerReviews/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── models/
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── unit/
│   │   └── integration/
│   └── index.js
├── RecommendationSystem/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── controllers/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── models/
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── unit/
│   │   └── integration/
│   └── index.js
├── shared/
│   ├── utilities/
│   └── middleware/
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Each bounded context has its own `src` and `test` directories. Inside the `src`, there are further divisions such as `controllers`, `services`, and `models`, which are typical layers in a Node.js application. 

- `controllers/` will contain request handlers
- `services/` will handle the business logic
- `models/` will define the data models

Tests are also segregated into `unit/` for unit tests and `integration/` for integration tests.

For example, in the `OrderProcessing` context, you might have:

- `createOrder.test.js` in `OrderProcessing/test/unit/`
- `orderProcessing.integration.test.js` in `OrderProcessing/test/integration/`

Each context's `index.js` would be the entry point to that particular microservice, setting up the server and routes as required.

Concerning libraries, since we are focusing on Node.js, the `express` framework would be a typical choice for handling HTTP requests. For the persistence layer, an ORM like `sequelize` could be used for SQL databases or `mongoose` for MongoDB. For Event Sourcing, you might use `node-eventstore-client` for integrating with an event store.

For testing,  `jest` is the testing frameworks, with `jest`'s own assertion library for assertions. For integration tests that require HTTP calls, `supertest` could be used.

Finally, the `shared` directory would contain code that's common across multiple services, such as utility functions and middleware.

This structure aims to keep each bounded context isolated, making the system more maintainable and scalable, following the principles discussed in the course.
