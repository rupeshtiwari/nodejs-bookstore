## Load testing pre-requisit 

After running a load test and before starting a new one, it’s good practice to reset the testing environment to ensure the accuracy of your results. Here’s what you can do to reset your machine:

1. **Stop the current load test**: If you're using a tool like Artillery, you can usually stop the load test by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the test is running.

2. **Restart the services**: If you want to ensure that your services are starting from a clean state for each test, you may want to restart them. If you’re using PM2 for process management, you can restart all processes with:
   ```sh
   pm2 restart all
   ```

3. **Clear caching mechanisms**: If you're using Redis or another caching system, you might want to flush the cache to ensure that your next test doesn't use any cached data from the previous run. For Redis, the command would be:
   ```sh
   redis-cli FLUSHALL
   ```

4. **Reset database state**: If your load test writes data to the database, you may want to reset the database to its original state. How you do this depends on your database system, but for MongoDB, you can drop the database or remove specific collections.

5. **Monitor and kill any lingering processes**: Sometimes, processes can hang even after you’ve tried to stop them. You can check for any remaining processes associated with your test using `lsof` or `netstat` for specific ports, and then kill them with the `kill` command. For example:
   ```sh
   # Find the process ID (PID) listening on a specific port
   lsof -i :[port_number]

   # Kill the process using its PID
   kill -9 [PID]
   ```

6. **Check system resources**: Ensure your system isn’t overly taxed from the previous test. You can use tools like `top` or `htop` on Linux/macOS to check system resources.

7. **Verify and Close Other Applications**: Make sure to close any non-essential applications that might skew the results of the load test by consuming system resources.

8. **Review and Save Results**: Before rerunning the test, save any results from the previous run that you want to keep for analysis.

9. **Run a small test**: Before doing a full-blown load test again, you might want to run a smaller version to ensure everything is functioning as expected.
